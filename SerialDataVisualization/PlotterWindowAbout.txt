Create a dynamic figure using matplot lib.
Data for the plot is received from a IDataSource(e.g. a SerialDataSource).
Specify a format_str how each line received from the
IDataSource should be interpreted. It is C++ <scanf> like:
%f for float, %d for integer. Example: <mag:%f,%f,%f> would expect
a line containing <mag> followed by three comma separated
float values. It it fits it will be added to the buffer in the IDataSink,
which is our DataPlotter, creating the figure.
Options:
+ format_str: scanf string to parsed
+ title: title of the figure
+ legend: how the axis should be labeled
+ max_sample: reduces the number of samples in the figure, dropping oldest ones
+ pause/resume: pauses/resumes the refreshing of the plot - time to save figures!
+ create/close: creates a new or destroys a plot.
