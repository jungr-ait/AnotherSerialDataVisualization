Store the content received from a IDataSource in a CSV file.

The <data/msg/line> is received from a IDataSource(e.g. a SerialDataSource).
Specify a format_str how each line received from the
IDataSource should be interpreted. It is C++ <scanf> like:
%f for float, %d for integer. Example: <mag:%f,%f,%f> would expect
a line containing <mag> followed by three comma separated
float values. It it fits it will be added to the buffer in the IDataSink,
which is our DataLogger, writing lines in a specified file.
Options:
+ format_str: <scanf> string to parsed
+ header: header of the file: e.g. <x,y,z>
+ filename: name of the desired csv <file>
+ create/close: creates a new or destroys a file.
+ flush: refreshes file on drive (slower)
